  <p class="info">Hello World! I hope you've
    been enjoying our tour but for this next part
    you'll be needing flash. You see we're entering
    1996, and flash was used frequently. So please
    take this time to download flash. We've already
    planted it into our tour. All you need to do is
    press the button below to activate it. We promise
    it's safe. Thank you and enjoy the rest of our tour!
